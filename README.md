# PhLIMBO

*This README is generated with the help of AI and heavily edited by me (GDucpm).*

**PhLIMBO** is a liberty-free (or simply FOSS) software Android game inspired by the memory challenge mechanics of *LIMBO* from *Geometry Dash*.
It is a fast-paced reflex and memory game where you must **track the correct key (button)**. This game is built with privacy and freedom in mind.  
**NOTICE!!! This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS for a particular purpose. You can view Sections 15 & 16 of the GNU General Public License, version 3.**  
*Not available on F-Droid. It was the initial plan that this would be on FD, but I'm too lazy for that, sorry.*

## Gameplay

PhLIMBO shows you a sequence of buttons that shuffle around with music.  
Music will play and you will see 7 red buttons and 1 green button before the buttons start to shuffle. When the buttons change to different colors, your goal is to **tap the button that was previously marked green**.  
Each round tests your focus and speed.
